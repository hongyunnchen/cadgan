We propose a novel procedure which adds *content-addressability* to any given
unconditional implicit model e.g., a generative adversarial network (GAN). The
procedure allows users to control the generative process by specifying a set
(arbitrary size) of desired examples based on which similar samples are
generated from the model. The proposed approach, based on kernel mean matching,
is applicable to any generative models which transform latent vectors to
samples, and does not require retraining of the model. Experiments on various
high-dimensional image generation problems (CelebA-HQ, LSUN bedroom, bridge,
tower) show that our approach is able to generate images which are consistent
with the input set, while retaining the image quality of the original model. To
our knowledge, this is the first work that attempts to construct, *at test
time*, a content-addressable generative model from a trained marginal model.


## Examples

We consider a GAN model from [Mescheder et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04406https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04406) pretrained on CelebA-HQ. We run our proposed procedure using the three images (with border) at the corners as the input. All images in the triangle are the output from our procedure. Each of the output images is positioned such that the closeness to a corner (an input image) indicates the importance (weight) of the corresponding input image.

## Demo

For a simple demo example on MNIST, check out this [Colab
notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gH2naGOwxYNz6OGDydc9SPz7AHJlc5u7). No local installation is required.

## Code

* Support python 3.6+

* `cadgan` is intended to be a Python module i.e., it can be imported in
  Python code. Reusable code should be put in this folder. Make subfolders
  (packages) as appropriate.

* This repo is set up so that once you clone, you can do

        pip install -e /path/to/the/folder/of/this/repo/

  to install as a Python package. In Python, we can then do `import cadgan as
  cdg`, and all the code in `cadgan` folder is accessible through `cdg`.

  * Automatic dependency resolution only works with a new version of pip.
      First upgrade you pip with `pip install --upgrade pip`.

* `ipynb` folder is for Jupyter notebook files.

## Dependency, code structure, sharing resource files

You will need to change values in `settings.ini`.  See
https://github.com/wittawatj/cadgan/wiki . We currently share large files
(e.g., model files) via Google Drive.

We provide an example script to run CADGAN in `ex/run_gkmm.py`

For example, here is the command to run CADGAN for celebAHQ dataset on lars pre-trained model:

    python3 run_gkmm.py \
        --extractor_type vgg_face \
        --extractor_layers 8 17 26 35 \
        --texture 0\
        --depth_process no \
        --g_path gan_data/celebAHQ_00/chkpts/model.pt \
        --g_type celebAHQ.yaml \
        --g_min -1.0 \
        --g_max 1.0 \
        --logdir log_celeba_vggface/ \
        --device gpu \
        --n_sample 1 \
        --n_opt_iter 3000 \
        --lr 1e-2 \
        --seed 9 \
        --img_log_steps 10 \
        --cond_path  input.txt\
        --kernel imq \
        --kparams -0.5 1e+2 \
        --w_intp 0

See run_lars_bedroom.sh, run_lars_bridge.sh, run_mnist.sh, run_CUB.sh for other model options.

* In case you want to experiment with the parameters, we use `ex/cmd_gkmm.py` to generate commands for multiple combinations of parameters. This requires `cmdprod` package available here: https://github.com/wittawatj/cmdprod
