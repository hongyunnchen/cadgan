# kbrgan

Conditional image generation with kernel Bayes' rule

* Use Python 3.x.

* `kbrgan` is intended to be a Python module i.e., it can be imported in
  Python code. Reusable code should be put in this folder. Make subfolders
  (packages) as appropriate.

* This repo is set up so that once you clone, you can do 

        pip install -e /path/to/the/folder/of/this/repo/

  to install as a Python package. In Python, we can then do 'import kbrgan as kbg',
  and all the code in `kbrgan` folder is accessible through `kbg`.

* `ipynb` folder is for Jupyter notebook files. 

* If you feel that your code is really a standalone script, you can also create
  a new folder at the root level to contain it, if you prefer that way.
