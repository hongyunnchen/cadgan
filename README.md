We propose a novel procedure which adds *content-addressability* to any given
unconditional implicit model e.g., a generative adversarial network (GAN). The
procedure allows users to control the generative process by specifying a set
(arbitrary size) of desired examples based on which similar samples are
generated from the model. The proposed approach, based on kernel mean matching,
is applicable to any generative models which transform latent vectors to
samples, and does not require retraining of the model. Experiments on various
high-dimensional image generation problems (CelebA-HQ, LSUN bedroom, bridge,
tower) show that our approach is able to generate images which are consistent
with the input set, while retaining the image quality of the original model. To
our knowledge, this is the first work that attempts to construct, *at test
time*, a content-addressable generative model from a trained marginal model.


## Examples

We consider a GAN model from [Mescheder et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04406https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04406) pretrained on CelebA-HQ. We run our proposed procedure using the three images (with border) at the corners as the input. All images in the triangle are the output from our procedure. Each of the output images is positioned such that the closeness to a corner (an input image) indicates the importance (weight) of the corresponding input image.
